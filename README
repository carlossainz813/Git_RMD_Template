This GitHub Repository contains data of X project.

The project consists of using hiPSCs to differentiate into distinct endoderm lineages liver, intestine and lung,
as well as mesoderm lineages such as hametopoietic progenitor cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.

In this repository you can see templates that can be used for RMarkDown webpages. Ways for me to show you the data
that has been obtained using Bioinformatic analysis.

Any comments or recommendations are welcome.
